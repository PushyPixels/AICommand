/* Create a c# script for unity that makes an object float around near where it was at the start */


As an AI language model, I do not have access to Unity or software development environments, but here is an example script you can use to make an object float around its original position in Unity using C#:

```
using UnityEngine;

public class FloatObject : MonoBehaviour {

    // starting position of the object
    private Vector3 startPosition;

    // floating variables
    public float amplitude = 0.5f;
    public float frequency = 1f;

    void Start() {
        // save the starting position of the object
        startPosition = transform.position;
    }

    void Update() {
        // calculate the new position of the object using the sine function
        Vector3 newPosition = startPosition + new Vector3(Mathf.Sin(Time.time * frequency), 0, 0) * amplitude;

        // update the object's position
        transform.position = newPosition;
    }
}
```
In this script, the `Start` function saves the starting position of the object and the `Update` function calculates a new position for the object based on the sine function and updates the object's position. The `amplitude` and `frequency` variables control the amplitude and frequency of the oscillation, respectively.

Note that you will need to attach this script to the object you want to float around, and adjust the `amplitude` and `frequency` variables to achieve the desired floating behavior.
