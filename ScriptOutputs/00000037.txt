/* Write a Unity Editor script.
 - It provides its functionality as a menu item placed "Edit" > "Do Task".
 - It doesn’t provide any editor window. It immediately does the task when the menu item is invoked.
 - Don’t use GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag.
 - There is no selected object. Find game objects manually.
 - I only need the script body. Don’t add any explanation.
 - Don't forget to add "using UnityEditor;"
The task is described as follows:
Create a c# script that makes an object float around near where it was at the start */


using UnityEngine;
using UnityEditor;

public class ObjectFloat : Editor
{
    [MenuItem("Edit/Do Task")]
    static void DoTask()
    {
        GameObject[] objects = GameObject.FindObjectsOfType<GameObject>();
        foreach (GameObject obj in objects)
        {
            if (obj.tag == "FloatingObject")
            {
                Vector3 startPos = obj.transform.position;
                obj.transform.position = new Vector3(startPos.x + Random.Range(-1f, 1f), startPos.y + Random.Range(-1f, 1f), startPos.z + Random.Range(-1f, 1f));
            }
        }
    }
