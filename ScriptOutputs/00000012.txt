/* Write a Unity Editor script.
 - It provides its functionality as a menu item placed "Edit" > "Do Task".
 - It doesn’t provide any editor window. It immediately does the task when the menu item is invoked.
 - Don’t use GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag.
 - There is no selected object. Find game objects manually.
 - I only need the script body. Don’t add any explanation.
The task is described as follows:
create a plane and a pyramid of cubes 10 cubes high floating above it.  The plane should have a box collider and the cubes should have box colliders and rigidbodies. */


using UnityEngine;

public static class EditorScript {
    [MenuItem("Edit/Do Task")]
    static void DoTask() {
        GameObject plane = GameObject.CreatePrimitive(PrimitiveType.Plane);
        plane.name = "Plane";
        plane.AddComponent<BoxCollider>();

        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            GameObject cube = GameObject.CreatePrimitive(PrimitiveType.Cube);
            cube.name = "Cube " + i;
            cube.transform.position = new Vector3(0, i + 0.5f, 0);
            cube.AddComponent<Rigidbody>();
            cube.AddComponent<BoxCollider>();
        }
