/* Write a Unity Editor script.
 - It provides its functionality as a menu item placed "Edit" > "Do Task".
 - It doesn’t provide any editor window. It immediately does the task when the menu item is invoked.
 - Don’t use GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag.
 - There is no selected object. Find game objects manually.
 - I only need the script body. Don’t add any explanation.
The task is described as follows:
create a plane and a stack of 10 cubes floating above it.  The plane should have a box collider and the cubes should have box colliders and rigidbodies. */

public class DoTaskEditor : Editor
{
    [MenuItem("Edit/Do Task")]

    {
        // Create the plane game object
        GameObject plane = GameObject.CreatePrimitive(PrimitiveType.Plane);

        // Create the stack of cubes and adjust the position of each cube
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        {
            GameObject cube = GameObject.CreatePrimitive(PrimitiveType.Cube);
            cube.transform.position = new Vector3(0, i, 0);

            // Add box collider and rigidbody components to each cube
            cube.AddComponent<BoxCollider>();
            cube.AddComponent<Rigidbody>();
