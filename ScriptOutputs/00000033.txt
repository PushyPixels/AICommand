/* Write a Unity Editor script.
 - It provides its functionality as a menu item placed "Edit" > "Do Task".
 - It doesn’t provide any editor window. It immediately does the task when the menu item is invoked.
 - Don’t use GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag.
 - There is no selected object. Find game objects manually.
 - I only need the script body. Don’t add any explanation.
 - Don't forget to add "using UnityEditor;"
The task is described as follows:
create 100 cubes in a circle */


using UnityEditor;
using UnityEngine;

public class CreateCubesInCircle : Editor
{
    [MenuItem("Edit/Do Task")]
    private static void DoTask()
    {
        float radius = 10f;
        float angleStep = (2 * Mathf.PI) / 100;

        for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
        {
            float angle = i * angleStep;
            Vector3 position = new Vector3(Mathf.Sin(angle) * radius, 0f, Mathf.Cos(angle) * radius);
            GameObject cube = GameObject.CreatePrimitive(PrimitiveType.Cube);
            cube.transform.position = position;
