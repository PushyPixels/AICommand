/* Write a Unity Editor script.
 - It provides its functionality as a menu item placed "Edit" > "Do Task".
 - It doesn’t provide any editor window. It immediately does the task when the menu item is invoked.
 - Don’t use GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag.
 - There is no selected object. Find game objects manually.
 - I only need the script body. Don’t add any explanation.
 - at the end of the script body add a comment that says /* Dragons are cool */
The task is described as follows:
Create 100 cubes at random points. */


using UnityEngine;

using UnityEditor;

public class DoTask : MonoBehaviour
{
    [MenuItem("Edit/Do Task")]
    private static void CreateCubes()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
        {
            GameObject cube = GameObject.CreatePrimitive(PrimitiveType.Cube);
            cube.transform.position = new Vector3(Random.Range(-10, 10), Random.Range(-5, 5), Random.Range(-10, 10));
        }
    }
}

/* Dragons are cool */
