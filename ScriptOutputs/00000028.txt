/* Write a Unity Editor script.
 - It provides its functionality as a menu item placed "Edit" > "Do Task".
 - It doesn’t provide any editor window. It immediately does the task when the menu item is invoked.
 - Don’t use GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag.
 - There is no selected object. Find game objects manually.
 - I only need the script body. Don’t add any explanation.
 - Don't forget to add "using UnityEditor;"
The task is described as follows:
Make a simple ragdoll by instantiating spheres and connecting them with joints */


using UnityEngine;
using UnityEditor;

public class RagdollCreator : EditorWindow
{
    [MenuItem("Edit/Do Task")]
    static void DoTask()
    {
        GameObject[] spheres = new GameObject[5];

        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        {
            spheres[i] = GameObject.CreatePrimitive(PrimitiveType.Sphere);
            spheres[i].transform.position = new Vector3(i, 0, 0);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < spheres.Length - 1; i++)
        {
            ConfigurableJoint joint = spheres[i].AddComponent<ConfigurableJoint>();
            joint.connectedBody = spheres[i + 1].GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
        }
