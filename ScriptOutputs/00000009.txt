/* Write a Unity Editor script.
 - It provides its functionality as a menu item placed "Edit" > "Do Task".
 - It doesn’t provide any editor window. It immediately does the task when the menu item is invoked.
 - Don’t use GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag.
 - There is no selected object. Find game objects manually.
 - I only need the script body. Don’t add any explanation.
The task is described as follows:
create a plane and a stack of 10 cubes floating above it.  The plane should have a box collider and the cubes should have box colliders and rigidbodies. */
